# Presentation
👋 Hello there! I'm Michal, a passionate programmer on a journey that started in 2020. My coding adventure kicked off with C++, just before wrapping up my engineering studies. While initially heading towards a master's degree, I pivoted to focus on technology, specializing in 'geoinformatics in forestry.'

🐍 Embracing Python gradually became my forte, alongside encounters with C and SQL during my studies. I honed my skills in spatial data processing, algorithm creation, and relational database theory. 

🚀 Post-graduation, I soared into the IT realm at Jacobs Engineering Group as a GIS Specialist. Recognized for advanced programming skills, I joined a U.S. startup. There, I contributed to a web app displaying infrastructure status in major U.S. cities and assessing natural threats to ongoing projects.

🔧 My role involved preparing spatial data and crafting automation tools using ArcGIS toolboxes, Python scripts, and arcpy library. I delved into JavaScript and VueJS, broadening my understanding of code dynamics.

💼 Delegated to diverse projects, I created Python scripts and tools, enhancing internal workflows. Presently, I'm diving deep into topics to kickstart my career as a full-fledged programmer, actively seeking knowledge and guidance.

📚 Always eager to learn, I'm on the lookout for insights on what to master next. Let's connect, collaborate, and code together!
